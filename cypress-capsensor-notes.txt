Notes on Cypress Cap sensor

PSoC 4100 does not use CSX (cross point sensor)
UDB = universal digital blocks (UDBs) for efficient implementation of programmable peripheral

PSoC 4100 family does not support CSX sensing method since 
it does not have UDB resources which is required to implement CSX for this family
